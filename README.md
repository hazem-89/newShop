About
"ducky" is a webshop app built in TSX (Typescript React).
This is only a mock-shop that fetches a fake api to place orders, with pre-coded products and users to log in as either admin or as a regular user. No real database has been implemented in this app.
All data for products and orders are stored in localstorage and can easily be viewed in the inspector.

We also used MUI (Material UI) as we needed to implement a react component library in this project.
Find the docs of mui here: https://mui.com/getting-started/installation/
